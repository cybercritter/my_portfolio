            <p>
                Hello all you cats and kittens! I grew up in a small town in Oklahoma
                (United States) and didn't fit in well in school. My parents got me a
                Tandy TRS80 in the early 1980's for Christmas and I found my passion.
                I began to write programs in Basic using game programming magazines at
                the time. Since Basic, I have used C/C++ (functional and OOD), Python,
                Perl and several web technologies. â€‹Over my 34 year career, I have
                developed software for many companies and the open source community.
            </p>

            <p>
                I currently live in Utah (United States) with my dog Charlie.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I love to hike, read, and develop software in my spare time. <br>

                I am a bit of a cinephile. I enjoy most types of movies. I pass on horror or slasher flix. <br>

                I follow the <a href="https://mlb.com/orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> and <a
